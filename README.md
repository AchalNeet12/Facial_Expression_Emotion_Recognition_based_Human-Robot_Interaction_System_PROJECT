# Facial Expression Emotion Recognition based Human-Robot Interaction System
- - -

## :clipboard:PROJECT OVERVIEW:

A Facial Expression Emotion Recognition (FEER) based Human Robot Interaction System aims to develop a system that can accurately recognize human-robot as well as human emotions based on facial expressions and subsequently interact with humans in a more natural and empathetic manner.


## :mag:DATASET:

The dataset used in this project is Facial Expression Recognition Dataset,It contains 48x48 pixel grayscale images of human-robot as well as human faces, each labeled with one of seven basic emotions like as.
- **Angry**
- **Disgust**
- **Fear**
- **Happy**
- **Neutral**
- **Sad**
- **Surprise**


##  ðŸ¤– Technologies Used:

- **A FEER system typically leverages a combination**
  **Computer Vision:**
 - Face Detection: Identifying faces within images or video frames. Â  
 - Facial Landmark Detection: Locating key facial features like eyes, nose, and mouth. Â  
 - Image Processing: Preprocessing images to enhance quality and extract relevant features.

  **Machine Learning:**
 - Feature Extraction: Extracting meaningful features from facial images, such as geometric features or appearance-based features. Â  
 - Model Training: Training machine learning models (e.g., convolutional neural networks, support vector machines) on large datasets of labeled facial expressions. Â  
 - Emotion Classification: Classifying facial expressions into different emotions based on learned patterns.

  **Deep Learning:**
 - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): Powerful neural networks capable of automatically learning complex features from images. Â  
 - Transfer Learning: Leveraging pre-trained models on large datasets to improve accuracy and reduce training time.

  **Python:**
 - Popular Programming Language: Widely used for machine learning and computer vision tasks. Â  
 - Libraries: Offers libraries like OpenCV, TensorFlow, and PyTorch for image processing, deep learning, and model development.

- By combining these technologies, FEER systems can accurately recognize and interpret human emotions, enabling a wide range of applications.
