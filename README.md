# Facial Expression Emotion Recognition based Human-Robot Interaction System
- - -

## :clipboard:PROJECT OVERVIEW:

A Facial Expression Emotion Recognition (FEER) based Human Robot Interaction System aims to develop a system that can accurately recognize human-robot as well as human emotions based on facial expressions and subsequently interact with humans in a more natural and empathetic manner.


## :mag:DATASET:

The dataset used in this project is Facial Expression Recognition Dataset,It contains 48x48 pixel grayscale images of human-robot as well as human faces, each labeled with one of seven basic emotions like as.
- **Angry**
- **Disgust**
- **Fear**
- **Happy**
- **Neutral**
- **Sad**
- **Surprise**

##  ðŸ¤– Technologies Used:
- **A FEER system typically leverages a combination**
- **Computer Vision:**
 - Face Detection: Identifying faces within images or video frames. Â  
 - Facial Landmark Detection: Locating key facial features like eyes, nose, and mouth. Â  
 - Image Processing: Preprocessing images to enhance quality and extract relevant features.
