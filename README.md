- - -

:clipboard:PROJECT OVERVIEW:
---

The primary aim of a FEER-HRI system is to enable robots to perceive and respond to human emotions, thereby fostering more natural and intuitive human-robot interaction. By analyzing facial expressions, the system can identify emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, disgust, and fear.
